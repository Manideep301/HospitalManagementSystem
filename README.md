# Hospital Management System

## Overview
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage all aspects of hospital operations. This includes patient management, appointment scheduling, doctor management, billing, and reporting. The system is built using Java for the backend and MySQL for the database.

## Features
- **Patient Management:** Add, update, and delete patient records.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule and manage patient appointments with doctors.
- **Doctor Management:** Add, update, and delete doctor profiles.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Database:** MySQL
- **IDE:** Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL Server
- An IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

## Setup Instructions

### Database Setup
1. Install MySQL Server.
2. Create a database named `hospital_management`.
3. Run the SQL scripts provided in the `sql/` directory to create the necessary tables.

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hospital_management;
   USE hospital_management;

   CREATE TABLE patients (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       age INT NOT NULL,
       gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE doctors (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       specialization VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE appointments (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       patient_id INT,
       doctor_id INT,
       appointment_date DATE
       FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id),
       FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(id)
   );



#Project Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
#Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-management-system.git
Open the project in your IDE.

Add the MySQL JDBC driver to your project. You can download it from the MySQL website and add it to your project's classpath.

Create a configuration file (e.g., db.properties) for your database connection:

properties
Copy code
jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_management
jdbc.username=root
jdbc.password=yourpassword
Write your Java code to connect to the database using JDBC. Here’s an example of how to connect to the MySQL database:

java
Copy code
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_management";
    private static final String USER = "root";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "yourpassword";

    }
}
Create the necessary Java classes for managing patients, doctors, appointments, and billing. Here’s an example of a simple Patient class:

java
Copy code
public class Patient {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String gender;
    private String address;
    private String phone;

    // Getters and Setters
}
Implement the logic for adding, updating, and deleting records in the database using JDBC.

Usage
Run the main application class from your IDE.
Use the console or a simple GUI to interact with the system and manage patients, doctors, appointments, and billing.
Contribution
Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name).
Make your changes.
Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature').
Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature-name).
Open a pull request.
